                Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
                How I wonder what you are.
                Up above the world so high,
                Like a diamond in the sky.
                Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
                How I wonder what you are!

                I was a girl in the village doing all right. 
                Then I became a princess over night. 
                Now I gotta figure out how to do it right. 
                So much to learn and see! Up in the castle with my new family. 
                And a school that's just for royalty.

                I'm a little teapot. Short and stouts. 
                Here is my handle. Here is my spout. 
                When I get all steamed up. I just shout. 
                Tip me over and pour me out. I'm a very special pot.
